Subject: [PATCH 19/38] Add GCC 4.8.2 patch for crtstuff.c

.. it directly included auto-host.h, it shouldn't, instead
tconfig.h includes that file, but only after defining
USED_FOR_TARGET so that things only needed for the host
are not defined when building target libraries and objects

+Don't include auto-host.h directly, As per the old comment.
+It breaks building glibc on Windows where caddr_t is defined
+as "char *" by auto-host.h,
+
+libgcc/
+	* crtstuff.c: Don't include auto-host.h directly.
